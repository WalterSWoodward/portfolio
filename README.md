# Walter S. Woodward's Portfolio Website

### Introduction

#### Hello and welcome to my very first portfolio website. The layout of this page is pretty self explanatory, although I have provided a little information on what I used to build each section below.

### Layout

#### NavBar
##### The NavBar is self explantory with the exception of a nifty little color alternator tab I added. A single color is initialized into the redux store, and randomly changes hue everytime the tab is clicked on. The different shades you see throughout the page are just layers of backgrounds with varying opacity properties.
#### About Section
##### This about section was composed using basic JSX and CSS (LESS).
#### Portfolio Section
##### The portfolio section once again makes use of redux store by automating the creation of cards to display information about my various projects.
#### Contact Section
##### The contact section was created using basic JSX/CSS as well as utilizing a third party app from www.formspree.com to manage the secure transmission of messages from my webpage.
